This repository contains my dotfiles/configs.

I use Ubuntu with KDE Plasma desktop environment and i3 as my window manager.

Run `./apply-config` to copy the config to the system, then `dev-workspace` to begin working.

## Keyboard remappings

I use a Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard (Windows layout) with the following keys swapped:
- Caps Lock -> Escape
- Up arrow -> Down arrow
- Delete -> Left Alt
