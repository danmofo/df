This repository contains my dotfiles/configs for Linux/macOS.

Run `./apply-config` to copy the config to the system. If you're on Linux, then `dev-workspace` to begin working - this won't work on macOS.

## Linux

- DE, KDE Plasma 5.27.11
- WM, i3

## macOS
The macOS configs are very minimal at the moment as I figure out a decent workflow, which is quite difficult when the smart people at Apple decided to use a meta key instead of CTRL that's used on Linux/Windows.

## Keyboard remappings

I use a Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard (Windows layout) with the following keys swapped:
- Caps Lock -> Escape
- Up arrow -> Down arrow
- Delete -> Left Alt - this is the i3 mod key.

## TODO
- Add a full list of software that's installed on each OS so it's easier to recreate envrionment after a full reinstall
